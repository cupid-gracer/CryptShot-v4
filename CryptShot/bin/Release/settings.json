  // "1" = Buy Limit Order, this means your buy order will be set to buy above your selected % above the market price. For people using large amounts of BTC this is useful because often your amount can take up alot of the sell volume, giving you a binance error and your buy order not filling. (Note: It will normally only take a few % above market price, but it is a safe option.) Option "2" = Normal market execution buy order. This will instantly fill your quantity of BTC set at the current market price.
